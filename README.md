# E-commerce Conversion Prediction

### Overview

This project aims to develop an AI model that predicts whether a visitor session on an e-commerce website will result in a purchase. By analyzing historical session data, the goal is to enhance the user experience and increase conversion rates.

### Problem Statement

The e-commerce company LushAura has observed that a significant number of visitors browse their website without making a purchase. To address this, they require an AI-powered solution that can predict, in real-time, whether a visitor will convert or not.

### Dataset

The dataset consists of historical session data containing various features that describe user behavior. Each session is labeled with whether a purchase was made or not.

### Approach

    1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and structuring the data for analysis.

    2. Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful features from session data.

    3. Model Development: Training machine learning models to predict conversion.

    4. Evaluation: Assessing model performance using relevant metrics.
